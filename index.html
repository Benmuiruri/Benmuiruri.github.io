      <p>
        Coding dangerously everyday to become a developer with enough
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, with both "hard
        skills" and "soft skills"
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
        benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join

      <h3>Background</h3>

    <h2>The Freelance Developer</h2>
    <p>
      Hello there, welcome to <strong> the home of the Dangerous Coder</strong>
      where I share my journey to programming mastery. My main focus is jekyll
      and ruby on rails. Jeykll is for small simple websites like this one, while ROR is for
      state of art ruby on rails applications.

            A little bit about myself....When I'm not on Call of Duty you
            will probably find me doing some back-end development, or dabbling
            a bit with some front-end development.

            A very interesting project by my brother, another <strong>Dangerous Coder</strong>.
            <a href="https://statement-readr.herokuapp.com/">Statement Readr</a> brings financial records data just one API endpoint away. With intuitive and user friendly docs, integrate our API in 5 minutes and start building amazing products. I am excited to be involved in this project.
